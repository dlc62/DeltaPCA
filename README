Usage:
------

pca.py -npt <number_of_spectral_data_points> -samp <sample_file_names> -ref <reference_file_name/s>

Optional arguments:
-skf <number_of_data_points_to_drop_from_start_of_spectrum>
-skl <number_of_data_points_to_drop_from_end_of_spectrum>
-name <name_for_labelling_output_files>
-npc <number_of_loading_vectors_to_print> (set to 1 by default)
-lam <lambda_value_for_baselining> (set to 10^6 by default)

Notes:
------
For analysing paired samples and reference spectra, the number of specified sample files
must be the same as the number of specified reference files, and they must be listed in
the same order.
To analyse a series of sample files against a common reference, multiple sample files may 
be listed, but only a single reference file can be.

Format of data files:
---------------------
Data files must be in .csv format. The left-most column must be the Raman shift wavelengths. 
Each subsequent column may contain a replicate spectrum. 
Alternatively, spectra may be "stacked" on top of one another down the 2nd column.
The Raman shift wavelengths may also be stacked down the first column although this is optional.
A single-line header may be included. This too is optional.

Examples:
---------
May be found in the "Examples" directory. The commands required to run each set of examples
are in the .run scripts.
